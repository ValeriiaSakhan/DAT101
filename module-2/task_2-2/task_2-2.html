      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You should use constants if the value of the constant will not be changed later on, while variables should be used when you don't want to assign value instantly, or change it later.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				They change the priority in which the calculating will be done, for example prioritizing 4-2 over 3*4, which changes the further result.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				You convert the text into string and use text.length function (?)
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can compare them using the comparing operation 2==3 to prove they are alike, or !== to prove they are not alike.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				We use different "equations" to check whether its bigger or not like == or !== and so on. If 3 is smaller than 4 you should use the symbol that will show that 3 is lesser than 4 for it to be true, the opposite or alike for false.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				It returns the random number between the values we gave to it. 
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				It gives you, what I would call it, the "left out number". For example 10/3 would equal to around 3.33 which is a flytall. Modulus shows us the heltall equation 9/3=3 and gives us back the left over number - 1.
