      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake up time is 7 then it prints the code given to if. That if we wake up at 7 we can take the bus to school. And then it checks the statement and if its not 7 then it prints either you have to take a car or train!</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Now we also added a statement that checks everything else except for 7 and 8. That means no matter the wake up time, in our case 6 am, you will take the train if you dont wake up 7 or 8</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If its less than 7 the program checks it and you have to take the train, but in case of 8 it tells you to take a car.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>I made an if else statement that checks if x (the given value) is bigger, equal or smaller than 0. If its bigger its a positive number, if its equal its 0, if its less than 0 then its a negative number :D</p>
