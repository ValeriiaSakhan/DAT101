      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, but then you have to have two variables (f.ex i and j), and therefore two conditions/increase decrease</p>
       <li> In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
      Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
      your answer.</li>
      <p>Technically, a while loop will run as long as the conditions aren't met, and as long these conditions aren't met it can be an infinite loop, but then you have to make such condition that can never be met (?) </p>
      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>The program takes in a random number (through math.random) from 1 to a million, including. Then it takes date now when it starts and additionally when it stops. The program takes different amount of attempts and time to calculate though. For us this happens within going live since the loop runs and only prints out when conditions are met. And yes it can perform other tasks too (if we are thinking like counters etc). </p>
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?</li>
      <p>Well currently the program is set to increase, so if we are thinking of changing the order whether it increases or decreases it is possible (like for example not from 1 to 10, but from 10 to 1), i is the variable in the for loop that is going to change (exactly go up), so while K stays mostly the same (only increased with each column), i is going to increase so long the condition (being 7) is not met making it a ros/column</p>
