      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Makes the code cleaner, more organized and easier to make adjustments/reuse later</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>Account type is a static object that holds information, or more specifically in our case account types. So it stores different kinds of accounts and their values. Since we are using classes we can just keep referring to this object and reusing it</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function</li>
      <p>Helps to hide data and only acess when need to. You can also create a private member by using a # (like we did with balance). It means that its not visible and can also only be accessed within a class if I remember correctly/p>
        <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>In our case it creates a new empty object that holds the classes "blueprint" you can say</p>
